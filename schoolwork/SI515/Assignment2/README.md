## Off The Cuff: An Ad-hoc Web-based VR Controller for Smartphones and Smartwatches

This is an exploration of web-based VR interaction design techniques using a smartphone and smartwatch as ad-hoc VR controllers. Using data captured from the deviceâ€™s inertial measurement unit (IMU), gestures are classified for use in three VR tasks: (1) switching between two controller models, (2) throwing a paper airplane, and (3) tossing a kite.


### To run this demo:
* Choose two devices. One will be used as the visual and one will be used as a controller. The controller device must be a mobile device like a tablet, phone, or smartwatch.<br>
* Open this page on each device: [https://katymadier.github.io/schoolwork/SI515/Assignment2/](https://katymadier.github.io/schoolwork/SI515/Assignment2/)<br>
* On the controller device, press the enterVR button. It looks like a pair of VR goggles.<br>

### Classified Interactions
#### Switching between arm models
* To select a paper airplane, the user holds the phone with the right hand, places the phone face down in landscape mode, then twists the screen up to face the user.  <br>
* To select the kite, the user holds the phone with the left hand screen facing the user in portrait mode, then twist the screen counterclockwise until the screen faces outward.  <br>

#### Throwing objects
* To throw a paper airplane, the paper airplane model will need to first be selected. Once in hand, the phone is held face down and then snapped forward forcefully by flicking the wrist. <br>
*  To toss a kite, the kite model will also need to be in hand first. To release the kite, the phone is held upright by the left hand and then snapped forward forcefully. <br>
