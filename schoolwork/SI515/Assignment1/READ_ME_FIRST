AUDIO LOOPER
By Katy Madier



To run this file, start the katymadier_assignment1.py file with python3. 
The individual audio recordings from this program will be saved into the audio folder. The mixed loop will be saved in this parent folder. When you want to start a new loop, delete all of the audio and loop files, but keep the audio folder. 

Have fun!
