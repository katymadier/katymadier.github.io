# katymadier.github.io

I am currently a second-year master's student at the University of Michigan School of Information. During this program, my work has been focused on research of augmented and virtual reality interfaces. This github has work from school projects, demos and tutorials, and prototype experiments. 

## Projects
### School Projects
* [A portfolio of my work created for SI539 Design of Complex Interfaces](https://katymadier.github.io/schoolwork/portfolio)<br>

### Experimentations
* [Demo: A-Frame & Sketchup](https://katymadier.github.io/demos/demo-aframe-sketchup-poptart/) <br>
* [Demo: Processing camera input and motion sensing (Mobile)](https://katymadier.github.io/demos/demo-camera-orientation/)<br>
* [Demo: A-Frame XR - placing OBJ model in scene (Mobile)](https://katymadier.github.io/demos/demo-aframexr-obj/): Requires WebXR browser<br>
* [Demo: AR.js with OBJ model](https://katymadier.github.io/demos/demo-arjs-obj/): Requires AR.js markers<br>
* [Demo: A-Frame XR & AR.js - positional sound](https://katymadier.github.io/demos/demo-arjs-positional-sound/): Requires AR.js markers<br>
* [Demo: A-Frame with motion and sound for Daydream or mobile](https://katymadier.github.io/demos/demo-aframe-sketchup-poptart/)<br>
* [Demo: A-Frame with physics for Daydream or mobile](https://katymadier.github.io/demos/demo-aframe-physics/)<br> 


## Built With

* [A-Frame](http://) - The web framework used web-based VR prototypes.
* [A-Frame XR](http://) - The web framework used web-based AR prototypes.
* [AR.js](http://) - Used with A-FrameXR for marker-based AR prototypes.
* [Unity3D](https://) - The game engine used for AR/VR prototypes.
* [Google Poly](https://) - All AR/VR demos use 3D models by Google Poly.
