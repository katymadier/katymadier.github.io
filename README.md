I am currently a second-year master's student at the University of Michigan School of Information. During this program, my work has been focused on research of augmented and virtual reality interfaces. This github has work from school projects, demos and tutorials, and prototype experiments. 

## Projects
### School Projects
* [A portfolio of my work created for SI539 Design of Complex Interfaces](https://katymadier.github.io/portfolio/)<br>

### Experimentations
* [Demo with aframe and sketchup](https://katymadier.github.io/poptart/) <br>
Demo: Web XR - Adjusting color based on device orientation<br>
Demo: AR.js with OBJ model<br>
Demo: A-Frame XR and AR.js with positional sound<br>
Demo: WebXR with AframeXR<br>
Demo: A-Frame with movement and sound for Daydream or mobile<br>
* [Demo: A-Frame with physics for Daydream or mobile](https://katymadier.github.io/demos/demo-aframe-physics/)<br> 
Demo: Unity with poptarts<br>
Demo: Unity with MCity for Windows Mixed-Reality<br>


## Built With

* [A-Frame](http://) - The web framework used web-based VR prototypes.
* [A-Frame XR](http://) - The web framework used web-based AR prototypes.
* [ARjs](http://) - Used with A-FrameXR for marker-based AR prototypes.
* [Unity3D](https://) - The game engine used for AR/VR prototypes.
