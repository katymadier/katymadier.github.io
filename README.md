# katymadier.github.io

I am currently a second-year master's student at the University of Michigan School of Information. During this program, my work has been focused on research of augmented and virtual reality interfaces. This github has work from school projects, demos and tutorials, and prototype experiments.

## Built With

* [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/) - The web framework used web-based VR prototypes.
* [A-Frame XR](https://mozilla.github.io/aframe-xr/) - The web framework used web-based AR prototypes.
* [AR.js](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/AR.js/blob/master/README.md) - Used with A-FrameXR for marker-based AR prototypes.
* [Google Poly](https://poly.google.com/) - All AR/VR demos use 3D models from Poly by Google.
