I am currently a second-year master's student at the University of Michigan School of Information. During this program, my work has been focused on research of augmented and virtual reality interfaces. This github has work from school projects, demos and tutorials, and prototype experiments. 

## My Projects
### School Projects
* [A portfolio of my work created for SI539 Design of Complex Interfaces](https://katymadier.github.io/portfolio/)<br>

### Experimentations
* [Demo with aframe and sketchup](https://katymadier.github.io/poptart/) <br>
Demo: Web XR - Adjusting color based on device orientation<br>
Demo: AR.js with OBJ model<br>
Demo: AR.js with positional sound<br>
Demo: WebXR with AframeXR<br>
Demo: Aframe with movement and sound<br>
Demo: Aframe with physics<br>
Demo: Unity with poptarts<br>
