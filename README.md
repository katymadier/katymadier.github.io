# katymadier.github.io

I am currently a second-year master's student at the University of Michigan School of Information. During this program, my work has been focused on research of augmented and virtual reality interfaces. This github has work from school projects, demos, and prototype experiments.

## Projects

* [Tensorflow PoseNet body tracking in VR (2019)](https://github.com/katymadier/katymadier.github.io/tree/master/demos/tsbodytracking)<br>
* [Kinect body tracking in VR (2018)](https://github.com/katymadier/katymadier.github.io/tree/master/demos/moviekinect)<br>
* [Face tracking with brfv4 library (2018)](https://katymadier.github.io/demos/chatting/dogface)<br>

* [A-Frame XR - placing OBJ model in scene (Mobile Required) (2018)](https://katymadier.github.io/demos/demo-aframexr-obj/): Requires WebXR browser<br>
* [AR.js with OBJ model (2018)](https://katymadier.github.io/demos/demo-arjs-obj/): Requires AR.js markers<br>
* [A-Frame XR & AR.js - positional sound (2018)](https://katymadier.github.io/demos/demo-arjs-positional-sound/): Requires AR.js markers<br>
* [A-Frame with motion and sound for Daydream or mobile (2018)](https://katymadier.github.io/demos/demo-aframe-sounds/)<br>
* [A-Frame with physics for Daydream or mobile (2018)](https://katymadier.github.io/demos/demo-aframe-physics/)<br>
* [A-Frame & Sketchup (2017)](https://katymadier.github.io/demos/demo-aframe-sketchup-poptart/) <br>


## Built With

* [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/) - The web framework used web-based VR prototypes.
* [A-Frame XR](https://mozilla.github.io/aframe-xr/) - The web framework used web-based AR prototypes.
* [AR.js](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/AR.js/blob/master/README.md) - Used with A-FrameXR for marker-based AR prototypes.
* [Google Poly](https://poly.google.com/) - All AR/VR demos use 3D models from Poly by Google.
